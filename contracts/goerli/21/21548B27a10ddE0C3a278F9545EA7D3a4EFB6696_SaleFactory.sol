/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();

/// the opcode can use contextually to inform how to run. Typically opcodes
/// will read/write to the stack to produce some meaningful final state after
/// all opcodes have been dispatched.
///
/// The only thing required to run a rain script is a `State` struct to pass
/// to `eval`, and the index of the source to run. Additional context can
/// optionally be provided to be used by opcodes. For example, an `ITierV2`
/// contract can take the input of `report`, abi encode it as context, then
/// expose a local opcode that copies this account to the stack. The state will
/// be mutated by reference rather than returned by `eval`, this is to make it
/// very clear to implementers that the inline mutation is occurring.
///
/// Rain scripts run "top to bottom", i.e. "left to right".
/// See the tests for examples on how to construct rain script in JavaScript
/// then pass to `ImmutableSource` contracts deployed by a factory that then
/// run `eval` to produce a final value.
///
/// There are only 4 "core" opcodes for `RainVM`:
/// - `0`: Copy value from either `constants` at index `operand` to the top of
///   the stack.
/// - `1`: Duplicates the value at stack index `operand_` to the top of the
///   stack.
/// - `2`: Zipmap takes N values from the stack, interprets each as an array of
///   configurable length, then zips them into `arguments` and maps a source
///   from `sources` over these. See `zipmap` for more details.
/// - `3`: Debug prints the state to the console log as per hardhat.
///
/// To do anything useful the contract that inherits `RainVM` needs to provide
/// opcodes to build up an internal DSL. This may sound complex but it only
/// requires mapping opcode integers to functions to call, and reading/writing
/// values to the stack as input/output for these functions. Further, opcode
/// packs are provided in rain that any inheriting contract can use as a normal
/// solidity library. See `MathOps.sol` opcode pack and the
/// `CalculatorTest.sol` test contract for an example of how to dispatch
/// opcodes and handle the results in a wrapping contract.
///
/// RainVM natively has no concept of branching logic such as `if` or loops.
/// An opcode pack could implement these similar to the core zipmap by lazily
/// evaluating a source from `sources` based on some condition, etc. Instead
/// some simpler, eagerly evaluated selection tools such as `min` and `max` in
/// the `MathOps` opcode pack are provided. Future versions of `RainVM` MAY
/// implement lazy `if` and other similar patterns.
///
/// The `eval` function is `view` because rain scripts are expected to compute
/// results only without modifying any state. The contract wrapping the VM is
/// free to mutate as usual. This model encourages exposing only read-only
/// functionality to end-user deployers who provide scripts to a VM factory.
/// Removing all writes removes a lot of potential foot-guns for rain script
/// authors and allows VM contract authors to reason more clearly about the
/// input/output of the wrapping solidity code.
///
/// Internally `RainVM` makes heavy use of unchecked math and assembly logic
/// as the opcode dispatch logic runs on a tight loop and so gas costs can ramp
/// up very quickly.

/**
 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
 * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is
 * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent
 * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.

///
/// Some examples include:

/// - Pooling resources with implied governance/reward tiers

/// A "membership" can represent many things:
/// - Exclusive access.
/// - Participation in some event or process.
/// - KYC completion.
/// - Combination of sub-memberships.
/// - Etc.
///
/// The high level requirements for a contract implementing `ITierV2`:
/// - MUST represent held tiers as a `uint`.
/// - MUST implement `report`.
///   - The report is a `uint256` that SHOULD represent the time each tier has
///     been continuously held since encoded as `uint32`.
///   - The encoded tiers start at `1`; Tier `0` is implied if no tier has ever
///     been held.
///   - Tier `0` is NOT encoded in the report, it is simply the fallback value.
///   - If a tier is lost the time data is erased for that tier and will be
///     set if/when the tier is regained to the new time.
///   - If a tier is held but the historical time information is not available
///     the report MAY return `0x00000000` for all held tiers.
///   - Tiers that are lost or have never been held MUST return `0xFFFFFFFF`.
///   - Context can be a list of numbers that MAY pairwise define tiers such as
///     minimum thresholds, or MAY simply provide global context such as a
///     relevant NFT ID for example.
/// - MUST implement `reportTimeForTier`
///   - Functions exactly as `report` but only returns a single time for a
///     single tier
///   - MUST return the same time value `report` would for any given tier and
///     context combination.
///
/// So the four possible states and report values are:
/// - Tier is held and time is known: Timestamp is in the report
/// - Tier is held but time is NOT known: `0` is in the report
/// - Tier is NOT held: `0xFF..` is in the report
/// - Tier is unknown: `0xFF..` is in the report
///
/// The reason `context` is specified as a list of values rather than arbitrary

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```

 * constructor() {
