/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

 * @title ArcadeItemsVerifier
 * @author Non-Fungible Technologies, Inc.
 *
 * This contract can be used for verifying complex signature-encoded
 * bundle descriptions. This resolves on a new array of SignatureItems[],
 * which outside of verification, is passed around as bytes memory.
 *
 * Each SignatureItem has four fields:
 *      - cType (collateral Type)
 *      - asset (contract address of the asset)
 *      - tokenId (token ID of the asset, if applicable)
 *      - amount (amount of the asset, if applicable)
 *
 * - For token ids part of ERC721, other features beyond direct tokenIds are supported:
 *      - A provided token id of -1 is a wildcard, meaning any token ID is accepted.
 *      - Wildcard token ids are not supported for ERC1155.
 * - All amounts are taken as minimums. For instance, if the "amount" field of an ERC1155 is 5,
 *      then a bundle with 8 of those ERC1155s are accepted.
 * - For an ERC20 cType, tokenId is ignored. For an ERC721 cType, amount is ignored.
 *
 * - Any deviation from the above rules represents an unparseable signature and will always
 *      return invalid.
 *
 * - All multi-item signatures assume AND - any optional expressed by OR
 *      can be implemented by simply signing multiple separate signatures.
