 * checks.
 *
 * Downcasting from uint256/int256 in Solidity does not revert on overflow. This can
 * easily result in undesired exploitation or bugs, since developers usually
 * assume that overflows raise errors. `SafeCast` restores this intuition by
 * reverting the transaction when such an operation overflows.
 *
 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.
 *
 * Can be combined with {SafeMath} and {SignedSafeMath} to extend it to smaller types, by performing
 * all math on `uint256` and `int256` and then downcasting.

/*
 * To be used if `b` decimals make `b` larger than what it would be otherwise.
 * Especially useful for fixed point numbers, i.e. a way to represent decimal
 * values without using decimals. E.g. 25e2 with 3 decimals represents 2.5%
 *
 * In our case, we get exchange rates with a 18 decimal precision
 * (Solidity doesn't support decimal values natively).
 * So if we have a EUR positions and want to get the equivalent USD amount
 * we have to do: EUR_position * EUR_USD / 1e18 else the value would be way too high.
 * To move from USD to EUR: (USD_position * 1e18) / EUR_USD else the value would
 * be way too low.
 *
 * In essence,
 * wadMul: a.mul(b).div(WAY)
 * wadDiv: a.mul(WAY).div(b)
 * where `WAY` represents the number of decimals
